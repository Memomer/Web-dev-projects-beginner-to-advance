# 200_js_projects
100 projects and there unique render that i made and thought of myself

## Reverse Engineering Projects
So what I am trying to do here is that I find projects on vanilla js, code it out once, trying to understand
how each part of the cog works, then extending or recreating that project myself from scratch( if i am not able
to code the project).

My plan is to get 100 projects and then 100 unique renditions.

## How the project files are organized
- There will 100 files in total, each file will contain source code for the original project
and the source code of original project's extension or recreation. 

## Project List->
- 1.)rock-paper-scissor
- 2.)(project-inspired from rock paper scissor)
- 3.)Color flipper
