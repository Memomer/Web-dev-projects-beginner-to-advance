# Web-dev-projects-beginner to advance
- This repo contains various projects on web-development. My purpose to start this repo was to improve as a developer. Here, I have included projects that i made myself and the ones I made using tutorials. The technical complexities of each project mostly increases as one ascends the post.


## I love making projects
- I want to take up this oppurtunity to make as many projects, discover and use various API's, Libraries and Frameworks, in the process hopefully contribute something to open source. 
- I find the fact that i can make an impact by coding out my ideas, i want to use this as a platform to express myself through my project.

My plan is to get done with 200 projects each project reflecting what i learned, I will try to add a readMe file explaining the stuff I learned with a gif-demonstration of each.

## How the project files are organized
- Projects from hackathons, youtube tutorials(FCC, WesBos, webdevsimplified etc) , my one ideas that i brought to life.

## Aim of this repo-
- I hope this repo inspires and helps beginners to learn by creating there own projects and provide then ideas to many projects with the code so they can review and check where they went wrong.
