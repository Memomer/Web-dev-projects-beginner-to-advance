# Web-dev-projects-beginner to advance
- This repo contains various projects on web-development. My purpose to start this repo was to improve as a developer. Here, I have included projects that i made myself and the ones I made using tutorials. The technical complexities of each project mostly increases as one ascends the post.


## I love making projects
- I want to take up this oppurtunity to make as many projects, discover and use various API's, Libraries and Frameworks, in the process hopefully contribute something to open source. 
- I find the fact that i can make an impact by coding out my ideas, i want to use this as a platform to express myself through my project.

My plan is to get done with 200 projects each project reflecting what i learned, I will try to add a readMe file explaining the stuff I learned with a gif-demonstration for each.

## Where these project ideas come from
- Projects from hackathons, youtube tutorials(FCC, WesBos, webdevsimplified etc) , ideas/personal-projects that i brought to life.

## Organization of each project folder-
Each folder will have all the necessary source code files and ReadME.md file which contains - 
   ### Things I learned
   ### Tutorial source if i have used one
   ### Helpful links containing more resources for the same
 

## Aim of this repo-
- I hope this repo inspires beginners to learn by creating their own projects and provides them with source code to review the code they write for projects.
